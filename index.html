 	 	<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
		 	<p>I have 7 years agency experience working across a variety of functions, from multi-channel planning & implementation, to digital strategy, client service management & analytics. These were held at Mediawise, Naked Communications, Carat and OMD in NZ, whilst in Australia I was with OMD and then sister agency m2m Sydney – where I was most recently the Digital Account Director. At m2m I further honed my digital skills while leading online strategy, video, display, performance, mobile & paid social for an agency of 47 with six digital specialists working below me. I have also overseen social, programmatic, SEM & SEO in agency whilst working across FMCG, SBE, retail, consumer electronics, fashion & entertainment verticals.
		 	<br>
		 	<br>
		 	Most recently I was worked in the programmatic landscape as a Strategic Account Manager for one of the largest Supply Side Platforms in Australia, PubMatic. This was to further strengthen my programmatic skills via an insider’s view of an advertising technology company, which I did at a rate faster than any SAM before me. Unfortunately in Q4 PubMatic dismissed 25% of their staff globally, affecting two of the eight in the Sydney office, including myself. So I am currently looking for interesting new opportunities in programmatic account management, digital strategy or digital marketing.
